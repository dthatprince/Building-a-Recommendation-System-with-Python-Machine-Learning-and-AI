# Building a Recommendation System with Python, Machine Learning and AI
Implementing different types of recommendation systems.

This repository contains the implementation of various recommendation systems using Python and machine learning techniques. The goal of these systems is to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and historical data.


## Introduction

In this project, we explore different types of recommendation systems and demonstrate their implementation using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NumPy. The implemented recommendation systems include:

- Classification-based Collaborative Filtering Systems - Logistic Regression
- Content-Based Recommenders - Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
- Correlation-Based Recommenders
- Model-based Collaborative Filtering Systems with SVD Matrix Factorization
- Popularity-Based Recommenders

Each recommendation system is implemented in a separate module and follows a modular structure, making it easy to understand and modify. We provide detailed explanations and examples in the code to facilitate comprehension.

## Recommendation Systems Implemented

1. Classification-based Collaborative Filtering Systems - Logistic Regression:
   - File: `classification_collaborative_filtering.py`
   - Description: This module applies logistic regression to predict user-item preferences and make recommendations based on these predictions.

2. Content-Based Recommenders - Nearest Neighbors Algorithm:
   - File: `content_based_recommender.py`
   - Description: This module uses the nearest neighbors algorithm to identify items with similar features and provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences.

3. Correlation-Based Recommenders:
   - File: `correlation_recommender.py`
   - Description: This module calculates item-item or user-user correlations to identify similar items or users and generate recommendations accordingly.

4. Model-based Collaborative Filtering Systems with SVD Matrix Factorization:
   - File: `svd_matrix_factorization.py`
   - Description: This module applies SVD matrix factorization to uncover latent factors that capture user preferences and item characteristics, enabling personalized recommendations.

5. Popularity-Based Recommenders:
   - File: `popularity_recommender.py`
   - Description: This module recommends items based on their overall popularity or frequency in the dataset, providing simple but effective recommendations.
